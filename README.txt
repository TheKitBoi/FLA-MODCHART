1. You must have Adobe Animate 2022 idk about the other versions tho
2. Open up the FLA
3. What text shows on screen is the instructions
4. Mess around with the arrows (Protip you can sync it in when you put the song)
5. Press the SWF Button or extract it
6. Play the SWF and wait for how long the frames take
7. Once it shows the save modchart thing put it in data/Your Song
